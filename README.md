The Platonic Elements is mostly known for being the core building blocks of reality from old greece.
There is one Platonic Element corresponding to each of the 'elements': Fire, Water, Air, Earth and 'Spirit'.

Platonic Element | Element 
---|---
Tetrahedron       | Fire    
Octahedron        | Air
Hexahedron (Cube) | Earth
Icosahedron       | Water
Dodecahedrona     | Spirit

Each of the Platonic Elements can be found by drawing straight lines between the nodes in certain pattern from the Flower Of Life grid, except the Dodecahedron.
An example of this is soon to come in the repo.
